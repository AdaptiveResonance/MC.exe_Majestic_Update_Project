Greetings Majesty!!

Community AI update project for the MC.exe program which was no longer officially supported as abandonware. 
This overhaul update focuses primarily on optimizing the AI and other 
mathematical values to be MUCH more reliable and self-sufficient.
The community AI update Project is run by myself.

Run official MCUpdater as admin
Install necessary language packs
Copy/Download the DATA folder from the community update into MC.exe main directory (ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Medieval Conquest\DATA)
Replace any contents of the MC.exe DATA folder with that of this community update

Initially, on release, the flee value was lower than that of a finishing hit. 
Resulting in the flee mechanic not working and AI running to their doom, while Regen
Was never implemented for the player.
Worry no more!!
