Initially on game release, the flee value was lower than that of a finishing hit. 
Resulting in the flee mechanic not working and AI running to there doom, while Regen
Was never implemented for the player.
Worry no more!!

More testing of specials
Optimize objects
Revamp financial system
Add English & Russian Language Packs
