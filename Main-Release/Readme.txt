Greetings Majesty!!

Community AI update project for the MC.exe program which was no longer officially supported. 
This overhaul update focuses primarily on optimizing the AI and other 
mathematical values to be MUCH more reliable and self sufficient.
The community AI update Project is run by myself.

Copy/Download DATA folder from community update into MC.exe main directory
Replace any contents of MC.exe DATA folder with that of this community update

Initially on game release, the flee value was lower than that of a finishing hit. 
Resulting in the flee mechanic not working and AI running to there doom, while Regen
Was never implemented for the player.
Worry no more!!
