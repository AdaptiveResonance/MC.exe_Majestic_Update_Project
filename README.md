# MC.exe_Project
Community AI update project for the MC.exe program which was no longer officially supported. 

This overhaul update focuses primarily on optimizing the AI and other 
mathematical values to be MUCH more reliable and self sufficient.

Check the main-release for personal installation.
Language support packs for English, Russian and French will also hopefully be added.

The community AI update Project is run by myself.
